Snap Framework HTTP Server Library
----------------------------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/snapframework/snap-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/snapframework/snap-server)

This is the Snap Framework HTTP Server library.  For more information about
Snap, read the `README.SNAP.md` or visit the Snap project website at
http://www.snapframework.com/.

The Snap HTTP server is a high performance web server library written in
Haskell. Together with the `snap-core` library upon which it depends, it
provides a clean and efficient Haskell programming interface to the HTTP
protocol.

Building snap-server
--------------------

## Dependencies

To build the Snap HTTP server, you need to `cabal install` the `snap-core`
library (which should have come with this package).

### Optional dependencies

If you would like SSL support, `snap-server` requires the
[openssl](http://www.openssl.org/) library.


## Building snap-server

The snap-server library is built using [Cabal](http://www.haskell.org/cabal/)
and [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/hackage.html). Just run

    cabal install

to install snap-server.

If you would like SSL support, pass the `openssl` flag to `cabal install`:

    cabal install -fopenssl


## Building the Haddock Documentation

The haddock documentation can be built using the supplied `haddock.sh` shell
script:

    ./haddock.sh

The docs get put in `dist/doc/html/`.


## Building the testsuite

The `snap-server` has a fairly comprehensive test suite. To build and run it,
run

    $ cabal configure --enable-tests            # for the stock backend, or..
    $ cabal configure -fopenssl --enable-tests  # for the SSL backend
    
    $ cabal build

From here you can invoke the testsuite by running:

    $ ./runTestsAndCoverage.sh

The testsuite generates an `hpc` test coverage report in `test/dist/hpc`.
